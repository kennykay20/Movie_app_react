# MOvie App

- The Movie App is a React-based web application that allows users to browse movies, mark their favorites, and manage authentication using JWT. The frontend is built with React.js, TailwindCSS, and CSS, while it interacts with two APIs:

1. Authentication & Authorization API - Handles user login and signup, returning JWT tokens.

2. The Movie Database (TMDb) API - Fetches movie data (images, titles, etc.) from TMDb API.

üöÄ Features

üîë User Authentication (Login & Signup) via JWT-based API.

üé• Movie Listing Page displaying movies fetched from TMDb.

‚≠ê Favorite Movies - Users can select favorite movies, stored in state and displayed on a separate page.

üé® Modern UI with TailwindCSS and standard CSS.

‚ö° Responsive Design for mobile and desktop.

4. Make sure you register on this website: https://www.themoviedb.org to fetch movies, it's a free website, it will send you an activation key, you active the key on your email, then navigate after login succesfully, to the settings on their page, and Click on API, after that you fill a form with any information they requested, like i said it's free, and it will give you an API_KEY and a token, you use that KEY, inside the ApiContext.jsx page, for the MovieAPI_KEY cos that API_KEY I have might have expired...
